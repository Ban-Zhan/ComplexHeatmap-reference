Complex heatmaps are efficient to visualize associations 
between different sources of data sets and reveal potential structures. 
Here the **ComplexHeatmap** package provides a highly flexible way to arrange 
multiple heatmaps and supports self-defined annotation graphics.

## General design

Generally, a heatmap list contains several heatmaps and row annotations.
