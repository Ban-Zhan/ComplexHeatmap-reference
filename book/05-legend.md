# Legend

The heatmaps and simple annotations automatically generate legends which are put one the right side
of the heatmap. By default there is no legend for complex annotations, but they can be constructed
and added manually. All legends are constructed by `Legend()` contructor. In later sections, we
first introduce the settings for continuous legends and discrete legends, then we will discuss how
to configure the legends associated with the heatmaps and annotations, and how to add new legends to
the plot.

All the legends (no matter a single legend or a pack of legends) all belong to the `Legends` class.
The class only has one slot `grob` which is the real `grid::grob` object or the `grid::gTree` object
that records how to draw the graphics. The wrapping of the `Legends` class and the methods designed
for the class make legends as single compacted objects and can be draw like points with specifying
the positions of the legends.

## Continuous legend

Since most of heatmaps contain continuous values, we first introduce the settings for continuous
legend. Continuous legend needs a color mapping function which should be generated by
`circlize::colorRamp2()`. In the heatmap legends and annotation legends that are automatically
generated, the color mapping functions are passed by the `col` argument from `Heatmap()` or
`HeatmapAnnotation()` function, while if you construct a separated legend, you need to provide the
color mapping function.

The break values provides in the color mapping function (e.g. `c(0, 0.5, 1)`) will not exactly be
the same as the break values in the legends). The finally break values presented in the legend are
internally adjusted to make the numbers close to 5 or 6.

First we show the default style of a vertical continuous legend:


```r
library(circlize)
col_fun = colorRamp2(c(0, 0.5, 1), c("blue", "white", "red"))
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo")
```



<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="52.5509042814961" />

`lgd` is a `Legends` class object. The size of the legend can be obtained by `width()`
and `height()` function.


```r
width(lgd)
```

```
## [1] 9.90409342447917mm
```

```r
# the three values are the height of the title, the gap between title and legend, 
# and the height of the legend. 
height(lgd)
```

```
## [1] 2.52525499131945mm+1.5mm+24mm
```

The legend which is actually a packed graphic objects composed of rectangles, lines, text can be
added by `draw()` function. In **ComplexHeatmap** pacakge, you don't need to use `draw()` directly
on legend objects, but it might be useful if you use the legend objects in other places.


```r
# code only for demonstration
draw(lgd, x = , y = , just = )
```

If you only want to configure the legends generated by heatmaps or annotations, you don't need to
construct the `Legends` object by your own, but the parameters introduced later can be used to
customize the legends by `heatmap_legend_param` argument in `Heatmap()` and
`annotation_legend_param` argument in `HeatmapAnnotation()`. It is still nice to see how these
parameters change the styles of the legend in following examples.

In following examples, we only show how to construct the legend object, while not show the code
which draws the legends. Only remember you can use `draw()` function on the `Legends` object to draw
the single legend on the plot.

For continuous legend, you can manually adjust the break values in the legend by setting `at`. Note
the height is automatically adjusted.


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", at = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="59.9662688648294" />

The labels corresponding to the break values are set by `labels`.


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", at = c(0, 0.5, 1), labels = c("low", "median", "high"))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="77.7462167814961" />

The height of the vertical continous legend is set by `legend_height`. `legend_height` can only be
set for the veritcal continous legend and the value is the height of the legend body (exluding the
legend title).


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", legend_height = unit(6, "cm"))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="52.5509042814961" />

If it is a vertical legend, `grid_width` controls the widths of the legend body. `grid_width` is
originally designed for the discrete legends where the each level in the legend is a grid, but here
we use the same name for the parameter that controls the width of the legend.


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", grid_width = unit(1, "cm"))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="75.2280696358268" />

The graphic parameters for the labels are controlled by `labels_gp`.


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", labels_gp = gpar(col = "red", font = 3))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="52.5509042814961" />

The border of the legend as well as the ticks for the break values are controlled by `border`.
The value of `border` can be logical or a string of color.


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", border = "red")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="52.5509042814961" />

`title_position` controls the position of titles. For vertical legends, the value should be one of
`topleft`, `topcenter`, `lefttop-rot` and `leftcenter-rot`. Following two shows the effect
of `lefttop-rot` title and `leftcenter-rot` title.


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foooooooo", title_position = "lefttop-rot",
    legend_height = unit(4, "cm"))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="67.7644664534121" />


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foooooooo", title_position = "leftcenter-rot",
    legend_height = unit(4, "cm"))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="67.7644664534121" />

Settings for horizontal continuous legends are almost the same as vertical legends, except that
now `legend_width` controls the width of the legend, and the title position can
only be one of `topcenter`, `topleft`, `lefttop` and `leftcenter`.

The default style for horizontal legend:


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", direction = "horizontal")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="148.575141486221" />

Manually set `at`:


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", at = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), 
    direction = "horizontal")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="143.018500861221" />

Manually set `labels`:


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", at = c(0, 0.5, 1), 
    labels = c("low", "median", "high"), direction = "horizontal")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" width="148.53607898622" />

Set `legend_width`:


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", legend_width = unit(6, "cm"), direction = "horizontal")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png" width="241.889763779528" />

Set graphic parameters for labels:


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", labels_gp = gpar(col = "red", font = 3), 
    direction = "horizontal")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png" width="148.575141486221" />

Title can be set as `topleft`, `topcenter` or `lefttop` and `leftcenter`.


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foooooooo", direction = "horizontal", 
    title_position = "topcenter")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png" width="148.575141486221" />


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foooooooo", direction = "horizontal", 
    title_position = "lefttop")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="223.84078699147" />

In examples we showed above, the intervals between every two break values are equal. Actually `at`
can also be set as break values with uneuqal intervals. In this scenario, the ticks on the legend
are still at the original places while the corresponding texts are shifted to get rid of overlapping.
Then, there is lines linking the ticks and the texts.


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", at = c(0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 1))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png" width="71.3048515419948" />

If the labels do not need to be adjusted, they are still at the original places and there will be no
links.


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", at = c(0, 0.3, 1), legend_height = unit(4, "cm"))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-40-1.png" width="52.5509042814961" />

It is similar for the horizontal legends:



```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", at = c(0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 1),
    direction = "horizontal")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png" width="198.623969611221" />

Set rotations of labels to 90 degree.



```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", at = c(0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.5, 0.9, 0.95, 1),
    direction = "horizontal", title_position = "lefttop", labels_rot = 90)
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png" width="141.73141199147" />

When the position of title is set to `lefttop`, the area below the title will also be taken into
account of calculating the adjusted positions of labels.


```r
lgd = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "foo", at = c(0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.75, 1),
    labels = c("mininal", "q10", "median", "q75", "maximal"),
    direction = "horizontal", title_position = "lefttop")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-46-1.png" width="311.66305261647" />


## Discrete legend

Discrete legends are used for discrete color mapping. The continuous color
mapping can be degenerated as discrete color mapping by only providing the colors corresponding
to the break values.

You can either specify `at` or `labels`, but most probably you specify `labels`. The colors
should be specified by `legend_gp`.


```r
lgd = Legend(at = 1:6, title = "foo", legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png" width="41.4311126148294" />


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = "foo", legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png" width="87.3686126148294" />

The position of title:


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = "foo", legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6),
    title_position = "lefttop")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-52-1.png" width="113.767070620079" />


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = "foo", legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6),
    title_position = "leftcenter-rot")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-54-1.png" width="102.582174786745" />

The size of grids are controlled by `grid_width` and `grid_height`.


```r
lgd = Legend(at = 1:6, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = "foo", 
    grid_height = unit(1, "cm"), grid_width = unit(5, "mm"))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-56-1.png" width="45.2106401738845" />

The graphic parameters of labels are controlled by `labels_gp`.


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = "foo", 
    labels_gp = gpar(col = "red", fontsize = 14))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-58-1.png" width="108.709758448163" />

The graphic parameters of the title are controlled by `title_gp`.



```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = "foo", 
    title_gp = gpar(col = "red", fontsize = 14))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-60-1.png" width="87.3686126148294" />

Borders of grids are controlled by `border`.


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = "foo", 
    border = "red")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-62-1.png" width="87.3686126148294" />

One important thing for the discrete legend is you can arrange the grids into multiple rows or/and
columns. If `ncol` is set to a number, the grids are arranged into `ncol` columns.


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:10], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:10), title = "foo", ncol = 3)
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-64-1.png" width="247.013769274934" />

Still the title position is calculated based on the multiplt-column legend.


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:10], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:10), title = "foo", 
    ncol = 3, title_position = "topcenter")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-66-1.png" width="247.013769274934" />

You can choose to list the legend levels by rows by setting `by_row = TRUE`.


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:10], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:10), title = "foo", 
    ncol = 3, by_row = TRUE)
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-68-1.png" width="252.938248441601" />

The gap between two columns are controlled by `gap`.


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:10], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:10), title = "foo", 
    ncol = 3, gap = unit(1, "cm"))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-70-1.png" width="307.486210219816" />

Instead of `ncol`, you can also specify the layout by `nrow`. Note you cannot use
`ncol` and `nrow` at a same time.


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:10], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:10), title = "foo", nrow = 3)
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-72-1.png" width="308.301191354987" />

One extreme case is when all levels are put in one row and the title are rotated by 90 degree.
The height of the legend will be the height of the rotated title.


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = "foooooo", 
    nrow = 1, title_position = "lefttop-rot")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-74-1.png" width="400.119545603674" />

Following style a lot of people might like:


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = "foooooo", 
    nrow = 1, title_position = "leftcenter")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-76-1.png" width="443.882566437008" />


`Legend()` also supports to use simple graphics (e.g. points, lines) as legends.
`type` argument can be specified as `points` that you can use number for `pch`
or single-letter for `pch`.


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = "foo", type = "points", 
    pch = 1:6, legend_gp = gpar(col = 1:6), background = "#FF8080")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-78-1.png" width="87.3686126148294" />



```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = "foo", type = "points", 
    pch = letters[1:6], legend_gp = gpar(col = 1:6), background = "white")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-80-1.png" width="87.3686126148294" />

Or set `type = "lines"` to use lines as legend:


```r
lgd = Legend(labels = month.name[1:6], title = "foo", type = "lines", 
    legend_gp = gpar(col = 1:6, lty = 1:6), grid_width = unit(1, "cm"))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-82-1.png" width="110.04577796916" />

## A list of legends

A list of legends can also be constructed or packed as a `Legends` object where the individual
legends are arranged in a certain layout. The legend list can be sent to `packLegend()` separatedly
or as a list. The legend can be arranged either vertically or horizontally.


```r
lgd1 = Legend(at = 1:6, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = "legend1")
lgd2 = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "legend2", at = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1))
lgd3 = Legend(labels = month.name[1:3], legend_gp = gpar(fill = 7:9), title = "legend3")

pd = packLegend(lgd1, lgd2, lgd3)
# which is same as 
pd = packLegend(list = list(lgd1, lgd2, lgd3))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-84-1.png" width="87.3686126148294" />

Simillar as single legend, you can draw the packed legends by `draw()` function. Also you can
get the size of `pd` by `width()` and `height()`.


```r
width(pd)
```

```
## [1] 19.1162787543403mm
```

```r
height(pd)
```

```
## [1] 72.0757649739583mm
```

Horizontally arranging the legends simply by setting `direction = "horizontal"`.


```r
pd = packLegend(lgd1, lgd2, lgd3, direction = "horizontal")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-87-1.png" width="203.254952017717" />


One feature of `packLegend()` is, e.g. if the packing is vertically and the
sum of the packed legends exceeds the height specified by `max_height`, it
will be rearragned as mutliple column layout. In following example, the maximum height 
is `10cm`.

When all the legends are put into multiple columns, `column_gap` controls the space between
two columns.


```r
pd = packLegend(lgd1, lgd3, lgd2, lgd3, lgd2, lgd1, max_height = unit(10, "cm"), column_gap = unit(1, "cm"))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-89-1.png" width="197.41439058399" />

Similar for horizontal packing:


```r
lgd1 = Legend(at = 1:6, legend_gp = gpar(fill = 1:6), title = "legend1",
    nr = 1)
lgd2 = Legend(col_fun = col_fun, title = "legend2", at = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1),
    direction = "horizontal")

pd = packLegend(lgd1, lgd2, lgd3, lgd1, lgd2, lgd3, max_width = unit(10, "cm"), 
    direction = "horizontal", column_gap = unit(5, "mm"), row_gap = unit(1, "cm"))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-91-1.png" width="357.589428518701" />

## Heatmap and annotation legends





```r
m = matrix(rnorm(100), 10)
Heatmap(m, name = "foo", heatmap_legend_param = list(
    at = c(-2, 0, 2),
    labels = c("low", "zero", "high"),
    title = "Some values",
    legend_height = unit(4, "cm"),
    title_position = "lefttop-rot"
))
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-93-1.png" width="504" />


```r
ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = runif(10), bar = sample(c("f", "m"), 10, replace = TRUE),
    annotation_legend_param = list(
        foo = list(
                title = "Fooooooo",
                at = c(0, 0.5, 1),
                labels = c("zero", "median", "one")
            ),
        bar = list(
                title = "Baaaaaaar",
                at = c("f", "m"),
                labels = c("Female", "Male")
            )
))
```


```r
ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = runif(10), bar = sample(c("f", "m"), 10, replace = TRUE))
Heatmap(m, name = "mat1", top_annotation = ha) +
Heatmap(m, name = "mat1", top_annotation = ha)
```

```
## Warning in .local(object, ...): Heatmap/annotation names are duplicated:
## mat1
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-95-1.png" width="504" />


```r
ha = HeatmapAnnotation(foo = runif(10), 
    bar = sample(c("f", "m"), 10, replace = TRUE),
    show_legend = c(TRUE, FALSE),
    annotation_name_side = "left")
Heatmap(m, name = "mat1", top_annotation = ha) +
Heatmap(m, name = "mat2", show_heatmap_legend = FALSE)
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-96-1.png" width="504" />


If heatmaps / annotations are added horizontally, heatmap legends and row annotations are put in one
viewport and column annotations are put in another viewport


```r
ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(foo1 = runif(10), 
    bar1 = sample(c("f", "m"), 10, replace = TRUE))
ha2 = rowAnnotation(foo2 = runif(10), 
    bar2 = sample(letters[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE))
ha3 = rowAnnotation(foo3 = runif(10), 
    bar3 = sample(month.name[1:3], 10, replace = TRUE))
ht_list = Heatmap(m, name = "mat1", top_annotation = ha1) + 
    Heatmap(m, name = "mat2", left_annotation = ha2) + 
    ha3
draw(ht_list, heatmap_legend_side = "bottom", annotation_legend_side = "left")
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-97-1.png" width="504" />


```r
draw(ht_list, merge_legend = TRUE)
```

<img src="05-legend_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-98-1.png" width="504" />
