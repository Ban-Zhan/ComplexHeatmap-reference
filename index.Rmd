# About {-}

This is the documentation of the
[**ComplexHeatmap**](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ComplexHeatmap/) package. Examples in the book
are generated under version `r installed.packages()["ComplexHeatmap", "Version"]`.

**Please note, this documentation is not completely compatible with older versions (1.*.*, before
Oct, 2018), but the major functionality keeps the same.**

If you use **ComplexHeatmap** in your publications, I am appreciated if you can cite:
