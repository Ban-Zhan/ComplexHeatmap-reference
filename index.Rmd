# About {-}

This is the documentation of the
[**ComplexHeatmap**](http://bioconductor.org/packages/ComplexHeatmap/) package. Examples
in the book are generated under version `r installed.packages()["ComplexHeatmap", "Version"]`.

**Please note, this documentation is not completely compatible with lower
versions (< 2.0.0, before Oct, 2018).**

If you use **ComplexHeatmap** in your publications, I would be appreciated if you can cite:
